We started the tour in London, and I wore a lot of Vivienne Westwoodâ€”she was so inspirational to me, so I wanted to wear a lot of vintage looks by her. I think my fashion decisions ended up influencing a lot of my beauty looks in a way: I cut bangs in the last year and have been <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/hair/a43376941/spiral-baby-hair-trend/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="playing with interesting shapes to make with my baby hairs" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">playing with interesting shapes to make with my baby hairs</a> and doing dramatic things with bangs. I also think we let all of the fabulous colors and prints of my suits really dictate a lot of the fun lip colors I wore. I really enjoyed getting to wear some bolder lip colors. I don't always wear lip color during the day, but it's very fun. So I got to play with a lot of Armani shades, which was lovely.</p><img alt="tessa thompson armani beauty" title="Tessa Thompson Armani Beauty" width=4160 height=6240 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/image3-642dd20831993.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Lacy Redway</span><p>Tessa Thompson poses for a picture during a stop on the Creed III press tour.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60"><strong>In addition to wearing bolder lip colors, are there any other ways your approach to makeup has changed since partnering with Armani Beauty?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think it's changed a lot actuallyâ€”I like to experiment when I'm lucky enough to work with really incredible artists, but my approach to makeup and beauty has been relatively simple on my own.

So, I think that I just frankly wear it more than I than I did before because the products are long-wearing, but also really easy and beautiful. Being a brand ambassador is really fun because I have so much more makeup around the house. My girlfriends and family members will end up coming over to my place and doing their makeup, and it's also inspiring to get to work with a company where so many women in my life that I love and care about a lot have now found a foundation or eyeshadow that they love. I even did my mom's makeup for my <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwC0B5x9RKU" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="launch party" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">launch party</a>â€”I've just gotten so much better at doing makeup! <strong><br></strong></p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60"><strong>Do you prefer wearing no makeup, no makeup-makeup, or bold makeup most days?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It sort of depends on what I'm doing. Luminous Silk I have such a relationship with because I've worn it for so long, and I find that I can do a look with that and their concealer, and it feels very sheer and very much like my skin, which is nice. But I think I also have just become so much more fond of wearing an overly pigmented lip, which is really, really nice. I've always been fond of lipstick and been a fan of it, but I think the context with which you can wear it and certain colors specifically has opened up for me.

I'm beginning to become a blush enthusiast, which is very new for me. But doing something that is a bit bolder with blush like that is something I'd really like to try a lot more.

I think my approach to beauty when I was younger was always wearing my hair down, and it was just kind of fussy. And now, typically when I feel my most beautiful it's really when my hair's pulled back, my skin is glowing, and just a lip to feel bold and most like myself. I think this idea of beauty and approach to makeup as enhancing that which exists has been really impactful for me, so, all of my beauty icons tend to be women who have done that.<strong><br></strong></p><img alt="bianca jagger" title="Bianca Jagger" width=2584 height=3823 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/full-length-view-of-bianca-jagger-standing-in-front-of-an-news-photo-1680724046.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">LGI Stock</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Bianca Jagger at an evening event in 1985.</p><img alt="grace jones" title="Grace Jones" width=3974 height=4364 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/photo-of-grace-jones-news-photo-1680724225.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Bob King</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Model and artist Grace Jones mid-performance.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60"><strong>If your friends or family members were tasked with describing your signature scent in one word, what do you think it would be?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That's so interesting, I'm really curious about what that would be.

So, those scents make me feel nostalgic for those days and summers in Brooklyn.<strong><br></strong></p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60"><strong>If you had to bring only one perfume, body oil, or scented lotion with you to a desert island, what would you choose?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Funny you should ask, because my friend ZoÃ« introduced me to this body butter that I use all the time by Simply Divine Botanicalsâ€”I'm wearing it nowâ€”and it's called <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033CWU6Y data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="How Now Brown Cacao" data-vars-ga-product-id=00769e35-969e-404a-8176-3be0dc189930 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033CWU6Y data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033CWU6Y data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://www.amazon.com/Simply-Divine-Botanicals-Brown-Cacao/dp/B0033CWU6Y?tag=harpersbazaar_auto-append-20" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/afflink/U4nb/amazon-simply-divine-botanicals-how-now","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","network":{"name":"Amazon"}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand="Simply Divine Botanicals" data-vars-ga-product-price=$34.95 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=adeb0138-4a26-4180-a470-c1b8a71b403f data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Simply Divine Botanicals" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Body Butter" class="body-link product-links css-1xesb7e e1aq0z090">How Now Brown Cacao</a>. It's cacao-scented and also, I've never tried this, but it feels like you can eat it, but it's a really thick body butter, and it's delicious.<strong><br></strong></p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60"><strong>What kind of scents do you typically gravitate toward?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I was in a store with my friend the other day, and I tried on this little body oil. And I had a friend who knows me really well smell it and she goes, "Oh, that's so much more floral than you typically like." I always thought I really liked floral scents, but apparently not. But I think a note that I like most consistently is floral, and that would be rose. I will always like a simple rose scent. It's so feminine and classic, and somehow earthy in a way, even though it's floral.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60"><strong>Who would you say is the best smelling person you know?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The best smelling person I know is a really good friend of mine named Ryan. And I would say a close second would be DevontÃ© Hynes, who's a very, very good smelling person who also really likes oud.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60"><strong>And who would you say smells better, Jonathan Majors or Michael B. Jordan?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Oh, that's unfair! Well, when we were making the movie neither of them smelled that great because they're doused in body oil and sweating a lot. But you know, I don't know, honestly. I think it's a tie. I'm going to see them this weekend, so I'll try to get a better read on who's better smelling. But, there's no top contender actually in my mind right now. It's a tough one, I need to research a little more.<strong><br></strong></p><h2 data-node-id=35 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60"><strong>OK, final question: What's something you've learned about beauty since joining the Marvel universe?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As I've mentioned, one thing that I love and felt really inspired by regarding being an ambassador for Armani Beauty is that it's a brand I've worn for a really long timeâ€”their foundations in particular. Not just in my actual life, but I can also look through my filmography and so many characters, including Valkyrie, wear that foundation because makeup artists also just love it so much. Butâ€”this is maybe not a sexy thingâ€”I've gained more of an understanding of how makeup wears over a long day. And in particular with Marvel because you're sweating. So, even in application, it's just adding moisture, especially if you're wearing something with a heavier coverage. After setting your makeup, it's a good idea to spritz yourselfâ€”actually rose water is really great for that.</p><img alt="thor ragnarok" title="Thor Ragnarok" width=2396 height=1116 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2023-04-05-at-4-12-51-pm-642dd655e954e.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Disney</span><p>A scene from Marvelâ€™s Thor Ragnarok.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And then another beauty hack that is very superhero-inspired is that, if you want a very lovely sheen on skin on the body, the best thing is sprayed sunscreen. And then if you're outside, it's also very good because obviously that gives you sun protection. But especially on film, spraying on sunscreen reads very beautifully. I actually learned that from Chris Hemsworth, so I have him to thank, but before takes they spray his muscles with sunscreen, even though we're inside.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tiffany Dodson is currently the associate beauty commerce editor at Harperâ€™s Bazaar, where she specializes in trend forecasting, building relationships with major and emerging brands, and crafting shopping storiesâ€”from holiday gift guides to product road tests.
