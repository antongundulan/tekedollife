It was Mrs Seabrook's 14th London marathon and her 256th marathon overall.</p><p>The three hold various records that most people of their age would not be considering, including a 12-hour running world record and the oldest finisher of the London to Brighton race.</p><p><b>Annette Curtis</b>, 40, completed her first - and last - marathon, raising more than £1,000 for the Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths. She chose the charity after her grandson, Alex-James, died last year from cot death. "It was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life, and I will never do it again," she said.</p><p><b>Paul Sussman</b>, 36, a writer from south London, felt the same after finishing his first marathon in just under five hours. "Never again," said Mr Sussman, whose 26 miles of "murder" was improved by Kathy Burke, the actress, screaming "Go, Pabs" along the course after he wrote his nickname on his T-shirt.</p><p>He had initially expected to easily beat his wife Alicky, 30, who works for the BBC, before discovering that she was not quite as unfit as he or her friends had predicted.</p><p><b>Paula Craig </b>found it difficult to believe that she had come third in the women's wheelchair race, insisting to the official who broke the news that he must be wrong.</p><p>The 39-year-old police officer from Oxhey, Herts, was paralysed from the waist down after an accident while training for a triathlon competition in 2001. After 21 weeks in hospital, Miss Craig was back in the gym in less than a month and is a regular marathon and triathlon competitor.</p><p><b>Jane Tomlinson</b>, 38, a mother of three from Rothwell, Leeds, ran despite suffering from terminal cancer and having just completed the John O'Groats to Land's End route by bicycle. She has raised more than £200,000 for charity. "I'm taking part because I want to, not to say 'Look what I can achieve'," she said.</p><p><b>Julia Kimbell</b>, 40, from Peterborough, Cambs, became the first blind and deaf woman to complete the London Marathon, finishing in under nine hours. She was accompanied by two guides and the team raised £500 for Deafblind UK.</p><p>The youngest female runner, <b>Stacy Aguis</b>, was celebrating her 18th birthday and first marathon. The oldest was Abraham Weintraub, 93.</p><p><b>Tom Isaacs</b>, 34, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, finished yesterday's marathon just two days after completing a 4,500 mile trek around the British coastline. He has raised £270,000 for the Parkinson's Disease Society.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwwcqnnLCrX2aBc4OTcWdoa2JsgXd505qjnqtdpLNurtGarZ6qqWKyr7DUq5inm5VisKmt0aKrsmWRo7Fuv8eenKtll6rBtHrHraSl</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./783417-50-cent-daphne-joy-diddy-lawsuit-trolling-hip-hop-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="50 Cent Keeps Trolling His Ex Daphne Joy Over Diddy Lawsuit Allegations">&larr;
