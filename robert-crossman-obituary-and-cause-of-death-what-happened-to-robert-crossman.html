The vibrant atmosphere of this city played a role in shaping Bob’s values and perspective. However, his sense of duty and dedication was most vividly demonstrated when he served in the US Navy during the tumultuous days of World War II. Entrusted with responsibilities on the submarine “Menhaden,” Bob faced challenges that required fortitude and courage, honing his leadership qualities.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Ties that Bind: Family and Business</strong></h3><p>In 1948, life presented Bob with two significant milestones. First, he married Glenayr Collins, a union that would endure for many decades. Their bond was one of mutual respect, love, and shared experiences. Second, after graduating from the reputable Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1950, Bob entered the family-owned Lindsay Weaving Company. It’s here that he collaborated with his brother Fred. Together, they navigated the complexities of the textile industry, with Bob eventually assuming the role of President until the business was sold in 1978.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Leadership in Community and Civic Organizations</strong></h3><p>Bob’s leadership was not confined to the business realm. His commitment to community welfare and development was evident in his active participation in numerous organizations. Serving on boards, including the Church of the Savior in Cleveland Heights and the Association for Management Excellence, showcased his dedication to various causes. Particularly noteworthy was his appointment by the Governor to the prestigious Executive order of the Ohio Commodores, underlining his contributions to the state.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Life in Sanibel and Numerous Associations</strong></h3><p>Sanibel, Florida, beckoned Bob in 1977, marking a new chapter in his life. His involvement in the Royal Palms Yacht Club and becoming a Founding Member of the St Charles Yacht Club were just the beginning of his maritime affiliations. His expertise in navigation and piloting also led him to teach courses for the United States Power Squadron. Furthermore, his leadership roles in the Shell Harbor Property Owners Association and the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation indicated his dedication to community welfare.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The World of Yachting and Exploration</strong></h3><p>An avid sailor and explorer, Bob, alongside his beloved Glenny, ventured into numerous sailing expeditions. Their most notable journey was a 6000-mile circumnavigation of the eastern United States, commanding a 46-foot motor yacht over five months. His passion for the maritime world also reflected in his literary contributions, where he penned articles delving into the intricacies of yachting and cruising.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Shell Point Village Chapter</strong></h3><p>In 1997, Bob and Glenny transitioned into the serene environment of the Shell Point Village Retirement Community in Ft. Myers. This decision provided them with an opportunity to indulge in tranquility while still actively participating in various community initiatives.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Bob: The Man Behind the Titles</strong></h3><p>Beyond his many accomplishments, Bob’s personal attributes left a lasting impression on all who knew him. His affinity for jokes, especially delivered in a Scottish brogue, showcased his lively spirit. Bob was beloved by many who knew him for his extensive knowledge, passion for literature and dedication to charity work. Though his passing left an irreplaceable hole, his legacy lives on through love, devotion and service to humanity.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Memorial and Continuation of Legacy</strong></h3><p>The community will gather on May 28 to celebrate Bob’s remarkable life at St. Michael’s & All Angels Episcopal Church in Sanibel, FL. As a testament to his lasting impact, in lieu of flowers, donations are encouraged to be made to the church or Young Life of Lee County, underscoring Bob’s lifelong commitment to supporting meaningful causes.</p><p>Robert Hamilton Crossman’s journey was marked by service, leadership, passion, and love.
