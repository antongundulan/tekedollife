Instead, she planned on going into music full-time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After acing her A’Levels exams,&nbsp;<strong>Michelle Jackson</strong>&nbsp;made a pivotal decision to dive headfirst into the world of music professionally. Stepping into the music scene in her late teens, she dedicated countless hours to perfecting her craft within the studio, fine-tuning her sound to resonate with her audience’s hearts.&nbsp;<strong>Michelle&nbsp;</strong>took on a blue-collar job to sustain herself financially, balancing her passion with practicality to cover her expenses.</p><p>As her melodies began to weave their way into the local airwaves,&nbsp;<strong>Michelle</strong>‘s career gained momentum, capturing the attention of an ever-growing fan base. Tirelessly promoting her music and engaging with fans, she graced stages across the United Kingdom, her performances electrifying crowds in clubs and events.</p><p>During this journey,&nbsp;<strong>Michelle Jackson</strong>&nbsp;crossed paths with another musical talent,&nbsp;<strong>Michael Collins Ajereh</strong>, known as&nbsp;<strong>Don Jazzy</strong>.

She is considered one of the sexiest female music stars in the UK music industry. She celebrates her birthday on the 17th of October annually and is currently 43 years old.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>&nbsp;made international headlines in April 2021 after&nbsp;<a href=#>Don Jazzy</a>, a leading Afrobeats icon, revealed that he was once married to the delightful singer.&nbsp;<strong>Don Jazzy</strong>, a music producer and founder of&nbsp;Mavin Records, is one of the top voices in the African music industry. So, when the record label boss posted the news on social media, it surprised the world. No one had imagined that&nbsp;<strong>Don Jazzy</strong>&nbsp;had been once married to&nbsp;<strong>Michelle Jackson</strong>.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<strong>Don Jazzy</strong>, the duo fell in love at a young age. It didn’t matter to the couple that&nbsp;<strong>Michelle&nbsp;</strong>was two years older. The duo got married when&nbsp;<strong>Don Jazzy&nbsp;</strong>was 20 and&nbsp;<strong>Michelle&nbsp;</strong>was 22. They tied the knot at a private ceremony in 2001.</p><p>Regrettably, the union didn’t last long and ended when&nbsp;<strong>Don Jazzy</strong>&nbsp;was 22. According to&nbsp;<strong>Michelle</strong>, the marriage collapsed because, at the time,&nbsp;<strong>Don Jazzy</strong>&nbsp;was more focused on his music career. The award-winning music producer had spent most of his time in the studio making music and was earnestly pursuing his dream of breaking into the Nigerian music industry. This decision caused a rift between the couple, which grew so big that they had to part ways.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, the couple remains good friends and constantly communicates. Five years after her separation from&nbsp;<strong>Don Jazzy</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Michelle Jackson&nbsp;</strong>gave birth to her son, who has grown into a teenager.&nbsp;<strong>Michelle</strong>‘s son turned thirteen on September 15, 2023. However, the identity of her son’s father is unknown.&nbsp;<strong>Michelle</strong>‘s current relationship is unknown, as the singer has been very tight-lipped about the topic.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Michelle Jackson</strong>&nbsp;has succeeded in building a small fortune off her music and fashion careers.
