S R Rao, who excavated a 15th century BCE site on the west coast of Gujarat, tells Pandit that “This was Krishna's Dwarka.” He shows a seal inscribed with a bull, unicorn and goat as mentioned in the epic Mahabharata.</span></span><h2>Is there any evidence of Lord Krishna?</h2>"There is sufficient evidence available now to suggest that Krishna was indeed a historical figure, who lived about 5000 years ago. This evidence is not just literary but also archaeological, geographical as well as astronomical," he claims.<h2>Where is Lord Krishna now?</h2>The pilgrimage (tirtha) site of Bhalka in Gujarat marks the location where Krishna is believed to have died. It is also known as Dehotsarga, states Diana L. Eck, a term that literally means the place where Krishna "gave up his body".<h2>Is Krishna a real God?</h2>Krishna, Sanskrit Kṛṣṇa, one of the most widely revered and most popular of all Indian divinities, worshipped as the eighth incarnation (avatar, or avatara) of the Hindu god Vishnu and also as a supreme god in his own right.<h2>Can Krishna stop time?</h2>The omnipotent Supreme Lord can do anything including stopping time. But He did not stop time while speaking Bhagavad Gita. It took about 45 minutes for Lord Krishna to speak all 700 verses.<h2>EVIDENCE Krishna is God himself | The Supreme Lord</h2><p></p><h2>Did Arjuna know Krishna was God?</h2>Yes, they knew. But Duryodhana was delusional. He underestimated Krishna's power.<h2>What language did Krishna speak?</h2>Sanskrit was the language spoken by him.<h2>Is Lord Krishna family still alive?</h2>End of the Vrishnis<p>These things in due time came to pass. A madness seized the people of Dwaraka so that they fell upon one another and were slain, together with all sons and grandsons of Krishna. Only the women and Krishna and Balarama remained alive.</p><h2>Who is the real God?</h2>God is described in the Quran as: "He is Allah, the One and Only; Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him." Muslims repudiate the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus, comparing it to polytheism.<h2>Will Lord Krishna come again?</h2>Lord Krishna has declared in the sacred Bhagavad Gita that He will take birth again and again to protect dharma and destroy evil. You should all grow with me.”<h2>How can I get Lord Krishna?</h2><p>Anyone can follow the teachings of this spiritual movement. To become a Hare Krishna, you must read the sacred texts, chant and meditate, and live your life based on the principles of Lord Krishna.<br>...<br>Study the Bhagavad Gita.</p><li>The soul.</li><li>One's relationship with God.</li><li>Bhakti Yoga.</li><li>Karma Yoga.</li><li>Gyaan Yoga.</li><li>Hatha-yoga.</li><h2>How beautiful is Lord Krishna?</h2>“Krishna's transcendental form has a reddish luster in seven places — His eyes, His palms, the soles of His lotus feet, His palate, His lips, His tongue and His nails. A reddish luster in these seven places is considered to be auspicious.<h2>Is there any proof of Radha?</h2>4.No evidence of Radha.<p>Despite the popularity of Radha Krishna love tale, there are no traces of the existence of Radha in Shrimad Bhagavatam, Mahabharata or Harivansham.</p><h2>Is there any proof of Ram?</h2>There is also no evidence — either historical or archaeological — which proves that Ram ever existed or that he ruled Ayodhya," claims Settar. However, there are some who beg to differ.<h2>Is Radha real?</h2>Unlike her paramour, Krishna, who may once have been a human hero elevated to divinity through legends, Radha is decidedly fictional.<h2>Where is Radha now?</h2>Life after Krishna left Vrindavan<p>According to Garga Samhita and Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Radha also left her home post Krishna's departure and went to Kadli vann (forest) leaving behind her illusionary form (also called Chaya Radha, her shadow) in Barsana.</p><h2>Is Radha alive?</h2>They are believed to have shared the love via their souls. But, the tragedy is that Lord Krishna never married his beloved Radha. The divine love story ended with the death of Radha.<h2>Is Mahabharat real story?</h2>Because Mahabharat is an epic, many people think that it is mythology and it was not true. It's all part of imaginations and one's perspectives. But this is not the case. Mahabharat was a real epic and it was a true event that happened in history.<h2>Where is real Bhagavad Gita kept?</h2>Over a billion people hold Bhagavad Gita in highest esteem, which encompasses the entire Vedic thought. Oldest manuscript of Gita, circa 1492, is with British in Bodleian Library, Oxford University."<h2>Did Krishna have children?</h2>While being her first wife, she was also the eldest and leading queen among all the queens, and according to the Mahabharata, Sri Krishna and Rukmini gave birth to 10 sons named Pradyumna, Charudeshna, Sudeshna, Charudeh, Sucharu, Charagupta, Bhadracharu, Charuchandra, Sochu and Charu and both of these also gave birth ...<h2>Is Bhagavad Gita real?</h2>The Bhagavad Gita is entirely representational and highly symbolic. There is no real battlefield or fight to be won; the entire text is a representation of the battle that goes on in our minds.<h2>Did Krishna cheat in Mahabharata?</h2>He did not cheat anywhere. He just played smart. Kauravas played unethically and killed Abhimanyu in the Chakravyuh. This triggered the anger in the pandavas camp and then they bend the rules to win the battle.<h2>How did Lord Krishna look like?</h2>The figure of Lord Krishna is depicted as having blue or blue-black skin. He holds a flute (bansuri) and sometimes accompanied by a cow or cowherd. Krishna is also known by many other names, such as Govinda, Madhusudhana, Vasudeva and Mukunda.<h2>Did Bhishma know Krishna was God?</h2>Bhishma replied that no one who had seen Krishna would be worried. The Lord then asked Bhishma to clear Yudhishtra's doubts. Bhishma humbly submitted that there was nothing he knew that the Lord did not know.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lmah6tbTEZqerp5%2BberCyjKWmq5xdoL%2Bqv8enmA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-kind-of-chips-can-diabetics-eat.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What kind of chips can diabetics eat?">&larr;
