He is the sixth of 11 children, and has five brothers and five sisters. The family relocated to Australia when he was 12 after his father, a railroad worker, won a large settlement for a job injury.</p><p id=e0ujYJx8c_ data-wc=45>The move came, in part, because Gibson Sr. wanted to avoid having his sons drafted to fight in the Vietnam War. As Mel's paternal grandmother had been an Australian opera singer, the move down under was, in a way, a return to the old country.</p><p id=eYWjO4I1RP data-wc=36>After attending an all-boys Catholic school in Sydney, Mel won a place at the prestigious National Institute of Dramatic Art when one of his sisters, recognising his latent talent, sent in an application behind his back.</p><h2>Early career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ae65a8e11b7d-mel-gibson-lethal-weapon.jpg><p id=ecMF_1Ypr- data-wc=56>Mel landed his first movie lead, soon after graduation, despite the result of a bar-room brawl the night before the audition which left him looking like "a busted grapefruit". In fact, Mel's burnt-out, beat-up appearance was a plus it was exactly the look director George Miller was looking for for his post-apocalyptic road flick.</p><p id=e5Ab4pcWrlt data-wc=55>Other roles in film and theatre soon followed, and in 1979 Mel scooped the first of a pair of Australian Film Industry Awards as Best Actor, playing an intellectually disabled handyman in He got the second two years later for his lead as an Aussie soldier caught up in WWI in Peter Weir's</p><p id=en_XFh7bbKD data-wc=30>Then came the worldwide success of and a romantic lead opposite Sigourney Weaver in , which clearly established Mel as an international star.</p><h2>Later career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6ed063448f56-mel-gibson-hacksaw-ridge.jpg><p id=eOkPa_-TvpD data-wc=76>In addition to starring in action fare such as 1988's , he has proved he's not just a pretty face in more demanding roles, memorably surprising the critics with his interpretation of Shakespeare's in 1990. Mel is probably best known for his role opposite Danny Glover in the movies, but it would be for his work behind the camera that he garnered his highest acclaim a best director gong for 1995's .</p><p id=eky5BiAE5eE data-wc=79>For Mel, who also produced the film, it was only his second time in the director's chair. The first being two years earlier for Clad in a kilt, sporting blue war-paint and speaking with a Scottish lilt, he also starred in the epic, which focused on the life of Sir William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish nobleman persecuted for his efforts to free Scotland from English rule. The film earned five Oscars, including Best Film.</p><p id=eIVZOnANfzi data-wc=82>In 2004 he released one of the most controversial film projects ever, , a portrayal of the last 12 hours of Jesus' life. Extremely violent, the film was equally praised and criticised, with many labelling the movie as anti-semitic. Mel co-wrote and directed the epic, filmed in a mixture of Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin with English subtitles, and, it being a labour of love for the deeply religious star, funded it with $25 million of his own money.</p><p id=e330mmkL8eL data-wc=42>The box office takings of more than covered the investment, raking in $125.2m (Â£68.2m) - and breaking the record set by - in its first five days.</p><p id=eg6IplfiCxG data-wc=16>The star continues to act with recent films including , and .</p><h2>Personal life</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5cbc7235c631-mel-gibson-rosalind-ross.jpg><p id=eicLGIPe0yU data-wc=68>In the midst of all his success during the 70s and 80s, he married dental nurse Robyn Moore, and, despite his potent sex-symbol persona, the two remained happily married for over 25 years. They have seven children the eldest, Hannah, was born in 1980, followed by twins Christian and Edward, Will, Louis, Milo, and the youngest addition to the clan, Thomas, who came into the world in 1999.</p><p id=exwaSqgpqh data-wc=43>He separated from Robyn after 26 years of marriage. It wasn't until April 2009 that divorce papers were filed, however - one month after Mel was photographed on a beach with another woman, who was later found to be Russian musician Oksana Grigorieva.</p><p id=e9lCEl_Kvj data-wc=17><strong>RELATED: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Meet the Celebrity OAPs (Old Age Papas): Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Mel Gibson & more</a></p><p id=eGofM5pS6r data-wc=95>It was alleged that the couple had been an item for three years and in October 2009, they welcomed their first child - a daughter named Lucia. The relationship wasn't to last. Amidst claims of domestic violence and a volatile relationship, they announced that they had split in April 2010 when they both took out restraining orders against each other. Things went from bad to worse when a string of leaked telephone recordings, allegedly between Mel and Oksana, hit the internet, reportedly demonstrating the dad-of-nine using racist language and threatening the mother of his baby.</p><p id=etj_qpVp6l data-wc=28>Mel has since moved on with former champion equestrian vaulter and writer Rosalind Ross. The couple welcomed son Lars in 2017, with the six-year-old being Mel's ninth child.</p><h2>Controversy</h2><p id=e1pYEDKMRd data-wc=55>In 2006, Mel was arrested after being pulled over while driving under the influence of alcohol. Anti-semitic comments he made to Jewish police officer James Mee made headlines across the globe, and the under-fire actor issued public apologies for his "despicable" behaviour, adding that his comments had been "blurted out in a moment of insanity".</p><p id=ekonS4jnxS data-wc=34>Incidents like this and the aforementioned alleged domestic abuse led to the actor being blacklisted from Hollywood for over a decade, a relationship that only began to thaw following the release of&nbsp;</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_lag0e70>More Profiles:</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9qaWBkuqa4jKCgm6ufo3w%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nia-long-interview-best-man-franchise-career-1235271504.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nia Long on Best Man Franchise, Career, Boston Celtics NBA Scandal  The Hollywood Reporter">&larr;
