However, weeknight dinners don’t have to consume your evenings or derail your healthy eating. On these nights when it’s challenging to pause—and you’re low on energy or patience—use this guide to make a quick and healthy low-glycemic dinner.&nbsp;</p><p>The following low <a href=#>glycemic index</a> (GI) recipes don’t contain many refined carbs or sugar and provide simple suggestions for a low GI meal plan when you just can’t stomach the idea of high-effort meals.</p><p>{{mid-cta}}</p><h2>Why Low-Glycemic Foods and Meals Matter</h2><p>Low-glycemic meals aren’t necessarily low-carb, but eating low-GI foods can help regulate insulin levels and avoid spikes in your blood sugar.1 This is important because the excess glucose not used by your body as energy can be stored as fat.2 Stable blood glucose levels after eating are good for weight loss and weight regulation. Keeping your blood sugar stable can also improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of dementia.3</p><p>Frequently eating high-GI foods may lead to higher risk factors for obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), heart disease, and inflammation.4 High-GI foods include simple carbohydrates, such as sugar, honey, and corn syrup, and processed carbohydrates, like crackers and bread.</p><h2>Tips to Build Healthy, Low-Glycemic Dinners and Meals</h2><p>Simple, low-glycemic dinner ideas can be full of nutrients and flavor. Keep these guidelines in mind when planning healthy, low-glycemic recipes for dinner:</p><ul role=list><li>Plan your meals at the beginning of the week so you know what ingredients you need on hand.</li><li>Meal prep earlier in the week for the nights you will not have time to cook.</li><li>Fill half your plate with vegetables at each meal (more about <a href=#>low-glycemic vegetables</a>).</li><li>Eat lean proteins, including seafood and poultry.</li><li>Choose sauces, dressings, and seasonings wisely, as many are packed with sugar, high fructose corn syrup, other refined carbs, sodium, and unhealthy seed oils.</li><li>When it comes to grains, make them whole and try to choose minimally processed grains such as <a href=#>quinoa</a> and barley.</li><li>Skip the low-fat foods where fat is often just replaced with extra sugar. Instead, find natural versions of these ingredients or swap them with whole foods.</li></ul><p>It’s important to remember that no two bodies are the same, and the impact that foods have on blood glucose levels will vary between individuals. A registered dietitian nutritionist can help you navigate the <a href=#>science behind the low-glycemic diet</a> and design a meal plan that fits your individualized nutrition needs.</p><p>&lt;p class="pro-tip">&lt;strong><strong>Learn More: </strong>&lt;/strong>&lt;a href="low-glycemic-breakfast">8 Low Glycemic Breakfast Ideas You’ll Love!&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></p><h2>15 Low-Glycemic Dinner Recipes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-global.website-files.com/63ed08484c069d0492f5b0bc/65c3d707bbfbe5f57ef7aacd_65c3cc829451a750ae2f7bbe_chickpea-hummus.webp><p>You might choose a low-glycemic diet to <a href=#>lose weight</a>, reduce your risk of developing diabetes, or better manage your diabetes. No matter the reasoning behind your choice, a low-GI diet doesn’t have to be boring or restrictive.</p><p>Now that you have low-glycemic dinner guidelines, here are 15 low-GI recipes to get you started and keep those blood sugar levels under control!</p><h3>1. Easy Low-GI Saffron Chicken Recipe</h3><p>Chicken is a healthy, go-to lean protein that many can enjoy. It provides many beneficial nutrients, such as iron and B12, which are crucial for blood and cell function.5 Plus, it’s highly versatile.</p><p>For example, <a href=#>this high-protein meal</a> combines savory chicken breast with the earthy-sweet taste of saffron and creamy Greek yogurt to provide a nutrient-dense, low-GI dinner. It is served over sauteed vegetables and cooked quinoa, helping you meet your nutrient needs and satisfy your hunger.</p><h3>2. Low-GI Cajun Shrimp Traybake</h3><p>When it comes to easy, healthy meals, traybakes are a staple. They’re simple and can be made in just a few minutes. You only need a lean protein source, veggies, olive oil, and seasoning. This <a href=#>Cajun Shrimp and Sweet Potato Hash</a> is a great example. It’s a Cajun cuisine made with simple seasoning over the top of shrimp, sweet potatoes, kidney beans, and corn. However, you can mix and match your ingredients and herbs any way you like!</p><p>You can use boiled sweet potatoes and corn to emphasize the low glycemic index of this low-GI dinner recipe. Boiling them minimizes the GI as opposed to other preparation methods.6 They’re also great sources of <a href=#>micronutrients</a> like vitamins A, C, and E.</p><h3>3. Simple Low-GI Tofu Stir-Fry Recipe</h3><p>Stir fries are another quick and easy low-GI dinner to add to your weekly menu. Sauteed proteins and veggies come together to create a delicious low-GI meal, and you can add quinoa to bulk it up.

Made with cauliflower rice and extra firm tofu; it’s a low-GI meal that’s also gluten-free and entirely vegan.</p><h3>4.

For example, this simple <a href=#>Cod and Veggie Packet bake</a> takes just 15 minutes to cook, and it’s packed with nutrients.</p><p>The Grilled Cod Foil Packets include a variety of vegetables, including zucchini, tomatoes, and green beans. However, you can add veggies according to your preference and season to taste. This low-carb dinner will surely be a satisfying meal, but you can also add a grain, such as brown rice, to make it more filling.</p><h3>5.
