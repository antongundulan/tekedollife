That’s all the stuff that is out there, the demons, that these kids are dealing with,'” Howard recalled in a 2005 <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a>. “And we were figuring out what we wanted to do as we were confronted with this stuff. … So the next thing you know, we are breaking all kinds of ground.

After high school, he captained the basketball team at Amherst College and was a member of an a cappella group before attending the Yale School of Drama.</p><p>He left school after two years and made his Broadway debut in 1968 in the original production of Neil Simon’s Promises, Promises.

When unions work out their differences, they become more united, more monolithic and do a better job of representing their interests.”</p><p>Actors overwhelmingly approved the merger in March 2012. Howard became co-president of SAG-AFTRA, then won re-election campaigns in August 2013 and August 2015.</p><p>“Ken was an inspirational leader, and it is an incredible loss for SAG-AFTRA, for his family and for everyone who knew him,” SAG-AFTRA acting president Gabrielle Carteris said in a statement. “He was a light that never dimmed and was completely devoted to the membership. He led us through tumultuous times and set our union on a steady course of excellence. We will be forever in his debt.”</p><p>In 1986, Howard took a break from the industry to lecture about acting at the American Repertory Theater at Harvard University, and he authored the book Act Natural, published in 2003.</p><p>Survivors include his wife, retired stuntwoman Linda Fetters Howard, and three stepchildren.</p><p>He earlier was married to actress Louise Sorel (Days of Our Lives) and Margo Howard, the daughter of Eppie Lederer, who dispensed advice as the syndicated newspaper columnist Ann Landers.
