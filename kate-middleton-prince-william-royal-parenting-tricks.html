And how <strong>she wants her children to grow up in the Scouting movement, not just in school,</strong> because she tries doing things at home but there's only so much you can do and you need to build relationships with other people."

When George was around six months old, Prince William and Kate hired a nanny, <a class=hm-link href=#>Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo</a>, to help them at home. Maria has since stayed on and has cared for Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, often taking the children to school and going on outings to the park.</p><p id=ecm2iWhT6owaG data-wc=41><strong>William and Kate have also found tremendous support in their parents, especially the Princess' mum Carole Middleton</strong>.

Prince William told Radio 1 that the family watches a lot of children’s programmes - George was a huge fan of , but then moved on to . And George expects mum and dad to watch the shows with him. <strong>"You have to pretend you're really interested in it because George gets very upset if you're not showing due diligence to the characters,"</strong> William said.</p><p id=eX349VXAnpLpe data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Kate Middleton's daily diet: the Duchess' breakfast, lunch and dinner revealed</a></strong></p><p id=e9sklIUAc4vH0><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f5f20748cd3d-kate-middleton-prince-george-princess-charlotte-royal-wedding-a.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><h2>Being outdoors is&nbsp;best</h2><p id=ecTjxloLdva_N data-wc=62>In an open letter to support Children's Hospice Week, published in May 2018, Kate revealed how she cherishes "simple family moments" with her children, such as "playing outside together." She wrote: "Spending quality time together is such an important aspect of family life and for me, as a mother, it is the simple family moments like playing outside together that I cherish."</p><h2>Kate does the arts and crafts — but William tries to take the credit</h2><p id=ewmD7d1TKFiMr data-wc=95>The Princess of Wales has an undergraduate degree in history of art, so it's no surprise she’s passing her love for art on to her kids. Kate does a lot&nbsp;of crafts with her little ones and even gives their creations to a certain special lady. William told Radio 1 that <strong>George and Charlotte made handmade gifts for their Gan-Gan, the late Queen, for her 91st birthday.</strong> But Kate was quick to quip, "Are you taking credit for the arts and crafts?" William, looking quite sheepish, said: "This is putting the marriage on the line."</p><p id=ezaAtcMicPFFi data-wc=64>Crafting with kids is definitely messy, but Kate doesn't seem to mind. Along with crafts, she often bakes with George and Charlotte. In August 2016, while in Luton, Kate met teenagers who were making chocolate crispy cakes. She told them: "When I try to do this with George at home, chocolate and the golden syrup goes everywhere. George makes so much mess. It’s chaos."</p><h2>They want their kids to be cultured</h2><p id=emifoIMBP8TVS data-wc=56>If you visit the Natural History Museum in London, you might run into Kate and the kids. She has taken George on numerous trips to the museum to see all the exhibits. In July 2016, during an official visit to the museum, Kate told a guest:&nbsp;"George loves three-dimensional sculptures. He does come here quite often."</p><p id=eMABfB3Ho6Bas data-wc=25>But don't worry, he's still a typical kid. George&nbsp;was once more interested in the pigeons outside the museum than all the amazing artwork inside.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/31743cf05888-william-hugging-george-a.jpg><h2>Their home is an "open" place</h2><p id=e5VOTAJDLdoPR data-wc=39>The British royals are known for their stiff upper lip and 'keep calm and carry on' attitude. But the couple launched their Heads Together campaign with Prince Harry in 2016 to encourage&nbsp;people to talk about their mental health.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLDobp8AtgvA6 data-wc=32>"Catherine and I are clear that we want both George and Charlotte to grow up feeling able to talk about their emotions and feelings," Prince William told magazine at the time.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2a3a36ddee1a-princess-charlotte-birthday-photo-a.jpg><h2>The internet is their mummy's friend</h2><p id=eA1414iwVb7xP data-wc=53>Who hasn't turned to an online forum to unload their worries? "Should she be walking yet? Why won't he sleep at night?" Kate is no different. <strong>She has reportedly used a pseudonym to post questions on sites like Mumsnet and Babycentre on issues she and William differ on</strong> - like cartoons before bed.</p><p id=eynb_KvioVzb3 data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Kate's family album: see photos of George, Charlotte and Louis</a></strong></p><h2>You'll see them at the school gates</h2><p id=eYUvxpACuE3ha data-wc=26>Kate wants George, Charlotte and Louis to have a normal school experience like she did, which means she does the school run as much as possible.</p><p id=e9SJckxdMfv54 data-wc=5>Photo: The Princess of Wales</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/346605e77236-kate-william-snow-z.jpg><h2>Bring on the activities</h2><p id=e4kyfBHPnnQI- data-wc=62>The royal couple are pretty active:&nbsp;they sail, they play football, they ski, and they're passing that love of fitness on to their kids. At their former home,&nbsp;Kensington Palace, you may have spotted&nbsp;George racing around on his scooter, with a helmet on, of course. "He goes super fast on it. It’s hard to keep up with him,"&nbsp;Kate once said.</p><p id=eplpt6sI49Tr9 data-wc=53>George also enjoys fencing (now that's a princely activity!) and football, alhough William admitted that Charlotte is the more skilled footballer. <strong>"George is sort of getting into it slowly, but Charlotte is showing more aptitude," the proud dad explained.</strong> Charlotte is also a keen horseback rider, just like her late great-grandmother the Queen.</p><h2>Some rules are meant to be broken</h2><p id=epf8gJKXAgLYe data-wc=58>William and Kate aren't above breaking some rules. For the first few months of George's life, the couple didn't have a royal nanny. Instead, Kate's mum, Carole, helped them adjust to parenthood. And George didn't even spend his first few weeks in a palace or castle! The new family of three stayed at Kate's family home in Bucklebury.</p><p id=eGVJl1DDyyHmK data-wc=35>The most notable tradition Kate and William have broken is sending George to two co-educational schools: first Thomas's Battersea school and then&nbsp;Lambrook, close to their new home in Windsor, along with both his siblings.</p><p id=eyV2mrepKTFDK data-wc=29>William and Harry both attended Wetherby School, which is an all-boys institution near Kensington Palace. William and Kate are clearly trying to give their kids a very normal upbringing.</p><p id=e8Z5BDQhn28-u data-wc=1><strong>GALLERY:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Prince William's cutest dad moments</a></strong></p><p id=ejhuFD284WLV3><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1aa68edfb2f6-princess-charlotte-party-a.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><h2>Wild is good</h2><p id=eCP-2Ek3y1HFm data-wc=36>The whole world is watching how William and Kate are raising their kids, but the pair don't seem concerned about making sure their kids are perfectly-behaved at all times. In fact, they welcome their wild personalities.</p><p id=emcFD1WigQGYg data-wc=61>Kate has admitted that Charlotte rules the roost at home and hilariously once told guests at Buckingham Palace that she didn't bring Charlotte because she would be&nbsp;"running riot." <strong>In 2016, William told rugby players that his kids are "Running around, pushing things, jumping. Please tell me it gets easier?" </strong>And of course, <a class=hm-link href=#>little Louis' facial expressions</a> during the Queen's Platinum Jubilee delighted royal watchers!&nbsp;</p><h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7c4231fcfa83-cambridges-school-z.jpg></h2><h2>Privacy is key</h2><p id=eFmM4cd5bAUP0 data-wc=20>The couple are fiercely protective of their children and even issued a <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>letter to the media</a> in 2015, asking them to respect their privacy.&nbsp;</p><p id=eCSF4av0ELEhZ data-wc=56>"They want both children to be free to play in public and semi-public spaces with other children without being photographed," a statement from Kensington Palace read. <strong>It's understandable that the couple were upset after paparazzi were seen following George and his nanny,</strong> going as far as hiding in cars to get photos of the young Prince.</p><p id=eYkxDIviL5kAN data-wc=70>In 2019, the couple <a class=hm-link href=#>planted 40-foot hedges in front of Kensington Palace</a> so that George, Charlotte and Louis could play outside without anyone being able to see them through the gate. At Anmer Hall, the family's country estate, there is a no-fly zone, so helicopters can't take photos of the children. Like all parents, William and Kate do enjoy publicly sharing adorable photos of their kids, but they only do it on big occasions like birthdays or christenings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dbb1e241af58-kate-middleton-cooking-a.jpg><h2>Being messy is good</h2><p id=eeWux4Trd2h4E data-wc=40>Just before going on maternity leave before the birth of Prince Louis in 2018, Kate revealed that her children love making pizza. Kate was visiting St Luke's Community Centre where she helped prepare food for their upcoming Commonwealth Big Lunch.</p><p id=euafw_3m76PyO data-wc=58>Speaking to a member, Yolanda from Bolivia, Kate said: "I've done that with George and Charlotte – making pizza dough. They love it because they can get their hands messy." Turning to an interpreter, she continued: "I was just saying how I really enjoy making pizza dough with George and Charlotte because they like getting their hands messy."</p><h2>Charity work is important</h2><p id=epVwBiuqqccRw data-wc=75>The Princess of Wales&nbsp;has said that her charity work has influenced her parenting style. While talking at the Royal Foundation Forum with husband Prince William, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Kate said: "You can't help but reflect on your own life and it's definitely had an impact on how sort of I look at how I mother, how we work as a family and you know, how we hope to bring up our children."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d02341034461-orla-leaving-polo-z.jpg><h2>The more, the merrier</h2><p id=euVQdMAAbiAwn data-wc=53>The Cambridge household is pet-friendly (despite the fact that there are many priceless heirlooms around). Before George was born, William and Kate got their dog, Lupo, an English cocker spaniel, who became a beloved member of the family. Sadly, Lupo died in 2020, with the royals sharing a heartfelt tribute announcing the news.&nbsp;</p><p id=eY-l9KxreOegj data-wc=31>In May 2022, though, the family released a series&nbsp;photos in honour of Princess Charlotte's birthday that featured their new&nbsp;cocker spaniel Orla, who has since been spotted on family outings.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
