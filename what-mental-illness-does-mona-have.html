The girls are rescued and come home after being diagnosed for having PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder) from their time spent kidnapped.<h2>Why is Mona in A mental hospital?</h2>After admitting to having accidentally murdered Charlotte, Mona Vanderwaal was admitted to Welby for one-year of heavy counseling before her release in "'Til Death Do Us Part."<h2>What was CeCe's mental illness?</h2>Mary could have been a woman on the Autism-spectrum scale, and CeCe could have had narcissistic personality disorder (she makes the transition from boy to girl look seamless and glamorous, which is a far cry from the reality of true trans teens).<h2>Does Mona have did PLL?</h2>Mona is a brilliant young woman who can speak French, hack computers, and do voice impressions. She can be considered a genius. She also has a personality disorder, which was diagnosed by Dr. Anne Sullivan while Mona was in Radley Sanitarium.<h2>The Difference Between Mental Health and Mental Illness with Dr. Saliha | Mental Health Awareness</h2><p></p><h2>Was Alison DiLaurentis A sociopath?</h2>Alison is revealed to be "A" and a psychopathic serial killer who murdered a total of seven people.<h2>Did Ali know Mona was A?</h2>Yes, Ali found out before the Liars that Mona was “A” during seasons 1-2. But - she only found this out sometime after A's return in the pilot episode.<h2>Why was Charlotte DiLaurentis A?</h2>During the sixth season, Charlotte is revealed to be Alison's cousin and adoptive sister. After being unmasked as "A," Drake revealed she was assigned male at birth as “Charles DiLaurentis” and underwent gender reassignment surgery in her youth.<h2>Does Ali know CeCe is A?</h2>In the episode, Alison, Aria, Emily, Hanna, Spencer and Mona finally uncover the true identity of "A," who turns out to be CeCe Drake, and they learn why she has been tormenting them.<h2>What is wrong with CeCe Drake?</h2>So, Cece is banished to a mental institution (Radley), because her parents believed she posed a threat to her siblings. But it's also probably because she's transgender. And that's just part of the problem with this episode.<h2>Who helped Mona be A?</h2>Lucas Gottesman: Aided Mona with her A schemes while she was in charge in season two.<h2>Why is Toby A?</h2>Toby Cavanaugh (Keegan Allen)<p>Toby isn't a top “A” like Mona. Instead he was a member of the “A Team,” as revealed in season 3, and helped Mona with her devious plans. Toby claims he only joined “A” as a way to keep Spencer safe.</p><h2>How did Mona become A?</h2>In the books, Mona becomes "A" as revenge for the Liars taking part in the blinding of Jenna Cavanaugh. In the TV show, Mona joins the "A-Team" because she feels that the Liars (possibly including Alison, as she received notes from "A" as well) "took" Hanna away from her.<h2>What eating disorder did Hanna Marin have?</h2>The most obvious example of PLL's unhealthy depictions of eating comes through the character of “Hefty Hanna,” the moniker given to main character Hanna Marin when she suffered from binge eating disorder.<h2>How did Ali get that scar on her thigh?</h2>A Dark Ali<p>As Alison tries to pull her bag off of Cyrus' shoulder, Cyrus tells her to “get off”, before he engages in a physical fight with her. Slamming Alison against a wall, Cyrus covers her mouth so she cannot scream, and taking a knife, Cyrus stabs Alison in the thigh.</p><h2>Is Jason on the A team?</h2>The Liars talked about how Jenna, Garrett and Jason were all working together, and "playing for the same team". This was the very first reference to the "A-Team". Later, in "A Hot Piece of A", the Liars begin to think that the person in the greenhouse wasn't actually "A", but a helper.<h2>Why did A put Alison in jail?</h2>Obviously A's mission in 5A was to discredit Alison in the Liars' eyes and make them believe she was A. The biggest betrayal came in episode 5x14 when the four girls stopped Ali from escaping to the police. That's how Charlotte put Alison in jail; and what happened there ? Ali got hurt.<h2>Who took Alisons body?</h2>Spencer comes downstairs and tells them she can't find Emily anywhere. Emily is in front of Alison's grave. Mona is in the grave, taking her body.<h2>Who dug up Ali's grave?</h2>Although Marlene did confirm that it was Mona & CeCe who dug up the grave - well, more like Mona dug up the grave under CeCe's orders.<h2>Are CeCe and Jason siblings?</h2>Charlotte DiLaurentis<p>She is the biological cousin of Alison and Jason DiLaurentis, but their adoptive sister. She is also the biological half-sister of Spencer, as they share a mother.</p><h2>Are CeCe and Spencer sisters?</h2>As Jenna is preparing to shoot her again, out of revenge for her and Charlotte, Mary Drake comes in and knocks Jenna out. Mary then cradles Spencer's body and reveals that she is indeed Spencer's mother, making Spencer the biological sister of Cece Drake.<h2>Why was Alex Drake A?</h2>Alex wanted to avenge Charlotte's murder, and believed the Liars knew who did it which pushed her to become the infamous Uber A. She was also jealous of the life that her twin sister was able to have, while she was abandoned by a rich British family.<h2>Who tortured Alison?</h2>The lair is revealed to really be Mona's, as she is A and had been the one torturing and stalking both Alison and the Liars.<h2>What did Melissa whisper to Mr Hastings?</h2>She buried her alive. This is what Melissa whispered to her father while waiting for Spencer in the police station last season and it's why Mr. Hastings wants her far away from Rosewood.<h2>Was Wren supposed to be A?</h2>Wren was never meant to be AD. Wren and spencer's twin were equal options for the role of AD but marlene chose spencer's twin to be AD and told troian about this idea during season 5. and cece was always meant to be A.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lnZq7ta3LZqClpJ6awLR5w6icrGWdpLuiecearZ4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-are-the-characters-in-my-favorite-chaperone-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who are the characters in my favorite chaperone?">&larr;
