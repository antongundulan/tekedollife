A national fixture for decades, Linkletter at one point had five shows running concurrently on network TV. Died May 26 at his Bel Air home at age 97.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Arthur Penn, director</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/arthur_penn_2010_a_p.jpg><p>His films often flew in the face of American mythology, no more so than the polarizing Bonnie and Clyde. A product of the golden era of live television and an accomplished theater director, Penn’s work on The Miracle Worker earned him an Emmy nomination in 1957, a Tony in 1959 and an Oscar nom in 1962. At one time, Penn had five hits running simultaneously on Broadway. Died Sept. 28 of congestive heart failure in New York one day after his 88th birthday.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Daniel Schorr, broadcast journalist</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/daniel_schorr_2010_a_p.jpg><p>He likened his TV coverage to that of a hard-nosed newspaper investigative journalist, one who researches an area extensively and then queries his interviewee with authority. His often controversial career spanned six decades, beginning as one of Edward R. Murrow’s recruits at CBS. Schorr joined CNN in 1979, becoming the nucleus of the fledgling cable outfit’s foray into round-the-clock news, and since 1985 he served as an analyst at NPR. Died July 23 in Washington after a short illness at age 93.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>David Brown, producer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/david_brown_2010_a_p.jpg><p>In partnership with Richard D. Zanuck, the Thalberg Award winners produced some of the most memorable films of the last quarter of the 20th century, including Jaws, The Sting, The Verdict and Cocoon. His films were nominated for four best-picture Oscars, he brought Elvis Presley to the big screen for the first time in Love Me Tender, and he talked George C. Scott into playing Patton. Died Feb. 1, 2010 in his New York home following a long illness at age 93.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>David L.

A showman in the broadest sense — he worked on the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles — Wolper's projects won more than 50 Emmys, five Peabody Awards, eight Golden Globes and one Oscar. He also produced several films, including Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory and L.A. Confidential. Died Aug. 10 of congestive heart disease and Parkinson's disease at his home in Beverly Hills at age 82.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Dennis Hopper, actor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dennis_hopper_2010_a_p.jpg><p>A personification of Hollywood rebellion, both on screen and off, Hopper biked to fame as director/co-writer and finger-flashing cyclist in 1969's Easy Rider. Hopper anarchic off-screen moves and drug use in the first half of his life cost him dearly in terms of his career, but later in life he straightened out and worked regularly. He also was nominated for an Oscar for his performance as an alcoholic high school basketball coach in Hoosiers. Died May 29, 2010&nbsp;at his home in Venice, Calif., after a long battle of prostate cancer at age 74.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Ed Limato, agent</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/ed_limato_2010_a_p.jpg><p>A powerful industry player for more than three decades, Limato repped some of the highest-profile actors in the business, including Richard Gere, Denzel Washington, Steve Martin and the frequently embattled Mel Gibson. Although Limato spent much of his career at ICM, he left that agency in summer 2007 during a restructuring shake-up to rejoin WMA, where he had worked from 1978-88. He stayed on after the merger with Endeavor to make the transition to the new WME. Died July 3, 2010&nbsp;of lung disease at his Beverly Hills home age 73.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Edwin Newman, broadcast journalist</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/edwin_newman_2010_a_p.jpg><p>A stickler for grammar and the English language who served NBC News for 32 years, Newman was one of the most respected men in broadcast news. He received a Peabody Award in 1966 for wit and depth of understanding for his radio news broadcasts, worked as a Broadway critic and twice hosted Saturday Night Live. Died Aug. 13 in Oxford, England of pneumonia Aug. 13 at age 91.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Fess Parker, actor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/fess_parker_2010_a_p.jpg><p>His stint on TV as a 6-foot-5 coonskin-capped Davy Crockett in the 1950s made him a lifelong favorite of baby boomers everywhere. His casting was a bit of a fluke; Walt Disney was screening the sci-fi movie Them! and looking at James Arness for the role, but Parker, in a bit role as a man frightened by an alien encounter, caught Disney's eye. Parker, while studying drama at the University of Texas, was discovered by actor Adolphe Menjou.&nbsp; Died March 17, 2010 of natural causes at his home in California's Santa Ynez Valley at age 85.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Gloria Stuart, actress</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/gloria_stuart_2010_a_p.jpg><p>The leading lady of the 1930s enjoyed a career revival for her Oscar-nominated performance as Old Rose in 1997's Titanic. The spry, engaging actress became the oldest Oscar nominee when, at age 88, she was nominated for a role for which she needed old-age makeup. Decades earlier, she starred in such films as The Invisible Man and Gold Diggers of 1935. Died Sept. 26, 2010 of respiratory failure in her sleep at her Los Angeles home at age 100.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Jean Simmons, actress</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/jean_simmons_2010_a_p.jpg><p>The lovely, ethereal film star played Ophelia to Laurence Olivier's Hamlet, sang with Marlon Brando in Guys and Dollsand played opposite Gregory Peck, Paul Newman and Kirk Douglas. Simmons was nominated for two Oscars and won an Emmy for her work in 1980s miniseries The Thorn Birds. On her move to Hollywood from Britain, Simmons was flabbergasted to learn that Howard Hughes had bought her “like a piece of meat.” Died Jan. 22, 2010 of lung cancer at her home in Santa Monica at age 80.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Jill Clayburgh, actress</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/jill_clayburgh_2010_a_p.jpg><p>Her Oscar-nominated performance in An Unmarried Woman as someone who suddenly finds herself single after a divorce reflected the growing women’s liberation movement. With willowy good looks, an edgy verve and singing ability, Clayburgh, also Oscar nominated for her work in Starting Over, was a versatile talent with a distinctive style that one observer characterized as "winsome naturalness." Died Nov. 5, 2010&nbsp;of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in her home as Lakeville, Conn., at age 66.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Ken Orsatti, negotiator</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/ken_orsatti_2010_a_p.jpg><p>His work as SAG’s chief mediator with the studios led members to record-setting earnings and a dramatic expansion of the union’s contracts. Known for his easy demeanor, Orsatti was SAG national executive director from 1981-2001 and negotiated about 20 major contracts. He announced his retirement shortly after the guild’s only strike during his tenure — a 2000 dispute over residuals from cable commercials that another negotiator handled. Died Aug. 31, 2010 of pulmonary disease in West Hills, Calif., at age 78.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>Lena Horne, singer-actress</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/lena_horne_2010_a_p.jpg><p>She began her show business career during the 1930s as a dancer at the Cotton Club in Harlem and was the first black singer to tour with a white band when she sang for the Charlie Barnet Orchestra during the '40s. Her sultry vocals and lithe beauty paved the way for black actresses and singers, and her rendition of “Stormy Weather" in the 1943 Fox musical vaulted her to stardom and became a classic. Died May 9, 2010&nbsp;at age 92.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Leslie Nielsen, actor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/leslie_nielsen_2010_a_p.jpg><p>He’s best remembered for Airplane! and as Lt. Frank Drebin in The Naked Gun series on TV and films, but Nielsen began his 60-year-plus career as a serious actor.
