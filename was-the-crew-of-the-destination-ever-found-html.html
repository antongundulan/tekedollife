The amount of time allowed for a season has continued to reduce – at one point, a red crab season was barely four days in length.

Others crab boats in the Bering Sea may reach lengths of 150 feet or more, and some are much larger.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span> <span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span> <span class=post-views-count>2</span><br>Spread the love<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6wmKxlpJ2ybq%2FRnq5mp5ZiwamxjJ2crKyZo661tc6nZJ6ulad6p7vUp5tnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-irish-from-702.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To Irish From 702?">&larr;
