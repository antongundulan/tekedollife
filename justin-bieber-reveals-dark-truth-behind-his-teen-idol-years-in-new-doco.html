It was so consistent, the pain was so consistent.</p><p>“I was just suffering, right? So, I’m just like, man, I would rather not feel this than feel this.”</p><p><b>RELATED:<a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=e1a88687681bf86ca04ebfeda8bd3127 data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev> Bieber ‘thought he was dying’ during drug addiction</a></b></p><p>Justin was discovered at the age of 13 by talent manager Scooter Braun thanks to his YouTube covers.</p><p>He previously revealed he first tried drugs at 13 and that his team feared for his life as he was always “popping pills”.</p><p>He was just 16 when he released his debut album, which topped the charts and catapulted him to fame.</p><p>The <i>Love Yourself </i>singer said he was shocked at all the “mean” comments he received as a teen, with trolls claiming he “looked like a girl”.</p><p>“I had no idea that I would get sucked up by all this stuff,” Bieber said. “There were just so many people who were so mean. Random people who were like, ‘You suck,’ ‘You look like a girl’.</p><p>“I would shake it off and act like it didn’t bother me, but that stuff bothered me and then it affected how I acted and how I treated people.</p><p>“It’s like thus ongoing cycle of like, hurt people hurt people. I was just this young kid.”</p><p>Speaking to Scooter about his struggles as a teenager, the singer explained: “You are this star that is supposed to have it all together.”</p><p><b>RELATED: <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=ad99aaade37652fb387f82d9c6dddb61 data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev>Bieber wishes he’d waited to have sex</a></b></p><p>He added: “You don’t realise the power of just saying, ‘Hey, this is how I’m feeling.’</p><p>“I just kind of let the insecurities of everything going on dictate how I started to move.”</p><p>Scooter confessed: “If I could do it all over again I would have had you in therapy day one and have someone separate to all of us [his team] to talk to.</p><p>“There’s so many tragedies that could have been avoided.”</p><p>Bieber stressed the importance of vocalising any feelings of loneliness to help ease the strain people put on themselves.</p><p>“I just would encourage people, like, ‘Hey, if you’re feeling lonely, talk about it. Say it out loud.’</p><p>“There’s a freedom in that. I could have avoided a lot of pain.”</p><p>Bieber’s drinking and addiction to drugs spiralled as his fame intensified. In 2014, he was arrested for drunk driving and driving without a valid licence.</p><p>Bieber has been candid about his mental health battles in the past.</p><p>Last year, he said he’d “made every bad decision” by the time he was 20, after fame had “gone to his head.”</p><p>Justin wrote: “It’s taken me years to bounce back from all these terrible decisions, fix broken relationships, and change relationship habits. “Luckily God blessed me with extraordinary people who love me for me.”</p><p>He also has Lyme disease – which he was diagnosed with after suffering with rashes, fever, headaches and exhaustion.</p><p>Justin and Hailey got engaged in July 2018 and wed in New York later that year, before tying the knot for a second in South Carolina last September.</p><p><i>This story originally appeared on <a class=body-link href=#>The Sun</a> and is republished here with permission</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmpJmbsnC21KyroqZdl7amrsSrZKudppqurb%2BMnZiro12pv7bAx2aZnqCZo7FutMisZK2dlaN6qrDOpWSynZGnwG61zWalnq9dmbyku46nnLCrXajBsL7YaG2abJNpgHOCmJqZm5uWZX94fcGdaGqaY5aGdoOPaZpw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./katie-holmes-asks-lookalike-teenage-daughter-suri-cruise-for-meaningful-help.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Katie Holmes asks lookalike teenage daughter Suri Cruise for 'meaningful' help">&larr;
