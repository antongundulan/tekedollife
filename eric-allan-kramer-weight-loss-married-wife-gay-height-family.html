He was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan to the father of Canadian football player, Roger Kramer.&nbsp;He is American and of white ethnicity.</span></p><p>He is popularly known for his role in the television series “Good Luck Charlie” as Bob Duncan.&nbsp;In high school, he was a normal kid who did ordinary things like playing and watching TV.&nbsp;However, Eric Allan Kramer’s outlook on life changed and what he wanted to accomplish transformed during his visit to the University.&nbsp;At the University of Alberta in Edmonton, he took the BFA program, which attracted him to a curiosity for cinema.&nbsp;It also led to his career in fight choreography.</p><h2><span>Eric Allan Kramer</span></h2><p><span>Eric Allan Kramer made his acting debut in 1987 portraying Luke Collins in the TV movie The Gunfighters.&nbsp;He starred in Thor in NBC’s The Incredible Hulk Returns and rose to prominence after portraying the lead role of Dave Rogers in the TV series The Hughleys.</span></p><p><span>His breakthrough role was in 2010 with him portraying Bob Duncan in the television series Good Luck Charlie.&nbsp;He has since appeared in numerous movies and TV shows, including Robin Hood: Men in Tights and True Romance.&nbsp;He has also made appearances in notable TV shows such as;&nbsp;Two and a Half Men, Wizards of Waverly Place, Growing Pains, Cheering, How I Met Your Mother, and so much more.</span></p><p>Allan went on to be a member of the Antaeus Classical Rep Company scene in Los Angeles.&nbsp;He also received an Ovatti Award nomination for his role in The Woodland Demon.&nbsp;Spurred on by his friend, Gary Sandy, he moved to Los Angeles.</p><h2><span>Net Worth</span></h2><p><span>Kramer’s towering body has landed him a wide variety of television roles.&nbsp;He has an athletic build with a height of 1.9m (6ft 3in).&nbsp;He has blue eyes and blond hair.</span></p><h2><span>Eric Allan Kramer Weight Loss</span></h2><p><span>In the movie Good Luck Charlie where he played the role of Bob Duncan, Eric weighed 260 pounds.&nbsp;He played the role of a cuddly middle-aged grandfather with a protruding belly to four cute children.&nbsp;However, in mid-2012 he began to search for what he ate and was seen heading to the gym as his weight gain began to kill his knees.&nbsp;Here is what he had to say to the QMI agency:</span></p><p><span>“At the start of the season I was limping with knee problems and felt really old and weak.&nbsp;When I looked at myself in the series, I did not recognize myself.&nbsp;I actually said, “Who is this guest star?&nbsp;and that’s when I said: shit!&nbsp;It’s time to get back to the gym.&nbsp;”</span></p><p><span>By the end of the shooting season, he had lost 15 kg, which allowed him to gain muscle and look very young.&nbsp;Her weight loss has been very inspiring to all her fans.</span></p><p>He takes his time at the gym very seriously, as evidenced by the way he tweets puns to say nothing at the gym.</p><h2><span>Eric Allan married or gay?&nbsp;His wife and family</span></h2><p><span>The Canadian actor has been the victim of false rumors about his wife and son all over the tabloids.&nbsp;International sites such as Famous Birthdays had claimed that Eric was married to James Bonci in 2013 and they have a son, Manny.&nbsp;Eric has since denied being married and having a son.</span></p><p><span>Eric learned of the existence of the rumors spreading like a bonfire and on July 19, 2013, he took to his Twitter to say that he loves the internet as it extended a lot of information about his personal life, even though it were wrong.</span></p><p><span>Currently, there is no verified information about his marriage, wife and children.&nbsp;This confused a lot of people about his sexuality.&nbsp;Some of these people have thought of him as being gay when he appears to be sexually straight.</span></p><p><span>Also, some other news sites claimed he has four children.&nbsp;They are Manny Kramer, Amity Kramer, Leianesse Kramer and Sedona Harlan Kramer.&nbsp;Even his biography on his twitter account has a full-time dad.</span></p><p><span>However, for a man who is outspoken, you would think he would have said something if there really was a family.&nbsp;We can only assume that he is busy with his professional life and maintaining weight loss currently, as they can be very demanding.</span></p><h2><span>Net value</span></h2><p><span>Although not fully verified, its online value is close to $2 million.&nbsp;It is expected to increase over time as it is not really short of function.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGidop6wbq3LpZinZZunrq6x0WaunqGXncFuuM6sqmalkae%2FqrHDZq6inpVitKLFjKGcop%2BYqXqnrcyio7Jn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./farm-divisions-nyt-crossword.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Farm divisions Crossword Clue">&larr;
