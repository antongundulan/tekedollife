Bay.</p><p>Celebrity chef Rick Stein was rumoured to be the mystery buyer of The Oaks in Neutral Bay paying close to $175m for the famous hotel with the help of a consortium of business partners.</p><p>The 76-year-old chef, restaurateur and popular television presenter splits his time between the UK and Australia but he was in Sydney over the summer <a class=body-link href=# title=www.realcommercial.com.au>around the time of the February sale</a>.</p><p>The real estate industry was ablaze with rumours on Thursday, the highly respected Stein was part of with a consortium of business partners who were the new owners.</p><p>Rick Stein is one of England’s best-known chefs, a restaurateur, and a popular television presenter.</p><p>He divides his time between Cornwall in the UK and Australia, married his Australian wife Sarah in 2011 and the couple share a home in Neutral Bay.</p><p><b>MORE:</b></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=#>Packer to create ‘unmatched’ mega penthouse</a></b></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=#>‘Auction of the year’: $6m over reserve</a></b></p><p>He launched Bannisters by the Sea in Mollymook in 2009 and then opened Bannisters in Port Stephens in 2018, both with extensive seafood menus.</p><p>Stein’s speciality is seafood.</p><p>However, the 76-year-old foodie, who also owns a home in Mollymook on the south coast, hosed down the rumours on Monday.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Bannisters advised: “I can 100 per cent confirm that neither Rick Stein nor [his business partner] Peter Cosgrove have bought The Oaks or have been involved in any negotiations to buy it.”</p><p>“At the moment, they’re not looking to purchase anything else – their focus is on their current portfolio of Bannisters at Mollymook and Port Stephens and Jacksons Ranch, their newest venue which has a weddings focus, at Bawley Point.”</p><p>The spokeswoman said Stein and Cosgrove [not the former Governor-general of Australia] were bemused as to how the rumour could have started.</p><p>“There’ve been rumours in the past like this about them expanding or buying something really big like this, but they’re completely unsubstantiated,” she said.</p><p>There is no denying Stein’s love of Australia, Sydney and the city’s north.</p><p>Rick’s Twitter account shows him on Balmoral Beach on February 4 revelling in the delights of summer in Sydney and drawing inspiration from iconic Aussie fictional character Les Norton.</p><p>“I was just thinking on Balmoral Beach how really special summer is in Sydney,” he wrote.</p><p>“The sky and sea are bluer than anywhere and white boats zipping everywhere.</p><p>“Do you know, I wouldn’t be dead for quids!”</p><p>Snippets of information that JLL Hotels & Hospitality Group had given out earlier included that the landmark hotel on Military Rd sold to a local family and long-time patrons of the pub.</p><p>There have also been reports the buyers are connected to the film industry.</p><p>The revered pub was listed in August last year <a class=body-link href=# title=www.realcommercial.com.au>with hopes of a $175m price tag</a>.</p><p>Those details puzzled people, as locals wondered who drinking at the Taffys Sports Bar alongside them had that sort of money.</p><p>JLL managing director John Musca wouldn’t comment on the new owner, saying he was bound by nondisclosure clauses.</p><p>For the past 50 years, <a class=body-link href=#>The Oaks </a>has been in the private hands of the Thomas family with David ‘Taffy’ Thomas about to pass over the keys to a Cornish man.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/content.api.news/v3/images/bin/c48a2052b0dc24ab7cd196724d9db5ee width=1920 height=1080 alt="The incredible new hotels opening in 2023" fetchpriority=high

for up to a five-storey development, subject to council approval.</p><p>The new owners are expected to take over this month.</p><p>Any sale over $160m would be a new record for the exchange of an
